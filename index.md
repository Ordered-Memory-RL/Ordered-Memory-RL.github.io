# Motivation

We aim to design a general policy network architecture so that it has a inductive bias to converge into the following subtask hierarchy as below. 
The agent wants to complete the task of building a bridge. 
This task can be decomposed into a tree-like, multi-level structure, where the root task is divided into `GetMaterial` and `BuildBridge`. 
`GetMaterial` can be further divided into `GetGrass` and `GetWood`.

This is a sketch on how this subtask structure should be represented inside the agentâ€™s memory during each time step. 
The memory would be divided into different levels, corresponding to the subtask structure. 
The <span style="color:blue">*vertical expansion* </span> corresponds to planning or calling the next level subtasks.
The <span style="color:red">*horizontal expansion* </span> can be thought of as an internal update for eachsubtask.
The black arrows are copy operations.

# Method: **O**rdered **M**emory **P**olicy **N**etwork (**OMPN**)

We achieve the goal described above with a fully end-to-end network. 
We use a multi-level memory slots where each slot represent one subtask.
The central concept in our model is **expansion position** from which the vertical expansion is performed. 

1.  **if the model thinks the current lower-level subtask is ended, then the expansion position should be high (c) so that the higher-level subtask is vertically expanded into a new lower-level subtask.**

2. **if the model thinks the current lower-level subtask is not ended, then the expansion position should remain low (a) so that the higher-level subtask is copied to achieve long-term dependency.**. 

The details of our design can be found in the paper.

# Task Decomposition with Behavior Cloning

Our main result is that by simply using behavior cloning on the demonstration dataset, the ground truth subtask structure would *naturally emerge* inside our model, which can be found by monitoring the expansion positions. In the following visualization, we plot the trajectories as well as the change of expansion positon over time.
